The code presents the BSM model and some associated aspects of the pricing theory. It analyzes how option prices and other quantities of interest react
to changes in the model parameters. The major topic is the Greeks, i.e. the delta and theta of an option. the code also introduces the CRR model. The code also covers the application to the binomial model
of Cox-Ross-Rubinstein which allows a closer look into the inner workings of Fourier pricing and allows a first assessment of the accuracy and speed of the approach.
